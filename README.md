### A Community-Driven YouTube Trending Page

This project is a website aimed at recreating the original, universal YouTube Trending Page, which was officially **discontinued in July 2025**.

The goal is to provide a single, non-personalized feed of videos that are currently gaining popularity across the platform, independent of individual user history.

## ✨ Features

-   **Global Trending Feed:** See what's popular _right now_, without algorithmic personalization.
-   **Simple, Familiar UI:** Designed to be a spiritual successor to the classic Trending tab.
-   **Video Details:** Quick view of video title, channel, and a summary of key metrics.
